# PINNs-for-Beginners
Tutorials for understanding PINNs (Physics Informed Neural Networks) by applying them to simple physics problems.

PINNs are used for solving the following types of problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs):
- Forward Problem : Solving a given PDEs for a set of initial and boundary condition.
- Inverse Problem : Discovery of PDEs for a given observational/experimental data.

We will first understand the aforementioned use-cases by considering the PDE used for describing the motion of a simple pendulum.
Next we will solve a more useful problem, heat-transfer in a rod, considering both 1D and 2D rod, along with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.

The tutorials are in the following sequence:
1. Pendulum  
   - Forward Problem  
   - Inverse Problem  
2. Heat Transfer (Steady-state, Dirichlet and Neumann B.C)
   - 1D Forward Problem
   - 2D Forward Problem
